# abl-zmq

A [ØMQ][1] binding for OpenEdge ABL.

## Status

This is a simple proof-of-concept at the moment. This could turn into a
KickStarter project or something if there is any interest, but I don't
think I will invest much personal time into it.

## License

The code I write is licensed under the MIT license. The vendored
binaries are built from the ØMQ project's official [LGPLv3+ source][2].
